        	<strong>In this project,</strong> you are going to model a computer game called Pong, first developed by Atari in 1972. You will write the code for the paddle which will allow it to move up and down based on user keyboard input and also write the code for the ball which will allow it to bounce every time it hits a wall or the paddle.<br />

                <!--<li>Play with the program <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U1L5Pong_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank"> linked here </a>to get a feel how the game works. Use the up and down arrow keys to move the paddle. The initial angle at which the ball starts is random, so if it is not to your liking, you can reload the page for a different initial angle.</li>-->

                    Discuss with your partner the mathematics behind the ball bouncing off the paddle. How does the initial direction of the ball as it hits the paddle relate to the final direction of the ball as it bounces off the paddle?  The following diagram may help. <br />

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <li>
                    Let each player (this is a two-player game) enter their name and select paddle and ball styles
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use at least ibe basic style with a filled rectangle and circle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create at least two other options for paddles and the ball using images.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>                    
                </li>
                <li>Paddles move up and down when the user presses the up arrow and down arrow keys for one player and the 'a' and 'z' keys for the other. Don't let the paddle move beyond the edges of the stage.</li>
                <li>Write the code to start the ball moving when green flag is clicked and to bounce off the stage edges and the paddle. Note that there is a built in block to bounce off the edges.</li>
                <li>
                    Keep score of the game. Every time the ball passes an opponent's paddle hits the wall, the player earns a point.<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Show the current score somewhere on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a player as earned 5 points display a message congratulating the player by name and show the final score.
                </li>

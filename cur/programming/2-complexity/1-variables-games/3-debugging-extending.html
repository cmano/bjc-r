    	<h2>Debugging and Extending Your Number Guessing Game</h2>
        
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will practice debugging, and you will make the computer give players hints.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>
                    <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/Lab6-Buggy-Secret-Number.xml" target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account."></a> In the file is a definition of a <code>number guessing game</code> block.  It has  a <strong>bug</strong>&mdash;an error in the code that makes the program behave differently than expected. This code, if you keep playing over and over, will mostly work, but <em>sometimes</em> (not often) it will congratulate you <em>before you even guess</em>.
                    <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair-mini.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" /> Analyze the code, explain how this can happen, and fix the bug.</p>
                </li>
				<div class="endnote">
                    <p>Have it pick its random number just from 1 to 3 to make the bug occur more often. Did that help you figure it out? If not, try adding this block at the start of the script: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-answer-block.png" alt="say answer" title="say answer block" /></p>
                    <p>
                        Can you figure out how to fix this problem? You can fix it with another script variable. If you want to add more script variables, use the right-pointing triangle. (The left triangle will remove them.)<br />

        <h3>Extending the Program with More Specific Responses</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Use more conditional blocks and predicates to make the computer tell the player whether a guess is too big or too small: "That's too big. Try again." <br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where in the code should these conditionals go?</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Test and debug.</strong> Play your game enough to see if it works the way you want. It should:
                    <ul>
                        <li>ask the player to guess its secret number;</li>
                        <li>say whether a wrong guess is too big or too small, and then ask again;</li>
                        <li>congratulate the player for a correct answer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
		<p>The script variable <var>secret number</var> exists only until the script finishes running. When the game is played again, the program will create a new <var>secret number</var> variable and give it a new random number.</p>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" />
		<p>In a later unit, you will teach the computer how to guess a secret number that <em>you</em> have chosen.</p>
        
        <h3>Advanced Learning</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Right now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10.  At the start of the game, ask the player what the maximum number should be, and make your program choose a number between 1 and <var>maximum</var>.</li>
				<li>Use another script variable to keep track of how many guesses the player makes before getting the right number. When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            Siri and other robots are programmed to generate language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have developed a program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. Now, you can extend  the computer's abilities with language by developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs the plural. <br />

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-boss-with-result.png" alt="plural boss (with result)" title="plural boss (with result)" /> <br /> Spelling a plural can seem almost automatic for a person, but it is not simple: a computer needs an algorithm to do that task.

            This assignment is a little different from previous ones. For this assignment you'll follow along this lesson. It is much more like the rest of the lab than other asssignments have been.

            <div class="sidenote">This project uses blocks already loaded for you from Snap<em>!</em>'s "Words, sentences" library. You can load a library from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> under "Libraries...".</div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To do this project, you will need to use the new blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-169x27.png" alt="last letter of" title="last letter of" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/all-but-last-letter-of-231x27 pixels.png" alt="all but last letter of" title="all but last letter of" />. You will also need <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate.png" alt="(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate" title="(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-117x27.png" alt="join" title="join" />, which you used in Lab 2, Gossip and Greet.<br />

                    Try all its expressions (the nine one-line scripts) and experiment with their inputs until you are sure you understand what they do. For each expression,  say what that script does <em>in general</em> not just what it does with this particular input. (Example: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-butterfly-with-result-y.png" alt="last-letter-of-butterfly-with-result-y" title="last-letter-of-butterfly-with-result-y" > reports <em>y</em>, but you want to say what <code>last letter of</code> will report if, say, <code>2017</code> is its input.)

                <div class="endnote">You  won't need <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-t-all-but-first-letter-of-when-343x33.png" style="height:2.6em;" alt="join-(t)-all-but-first-letter-of-when" title="join-(t)-all-but-first-letter-of-when" /> this for the project, but you might find it interesting to try it not only with "when," as an input but with "where,"  "what,"  "wherefore." Linguists use evidence like this to understand the history of a language.</div>

                <li>Here's one way to start building the <code>plural</code> block. Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit and fix it. <br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-(script).png"  alt="plural-(script), first try" title="plural-(script), first try" /></li>                
                <li><strong>Debugging: </strong> Try to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. List  the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get wrong some words that end with the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find many words it gets wrong. </li>

                <li>
                    Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list. Leave the  slot in <code>plural</code>  <strong>empty</strong>, as you see here. The <code>map</code> block inserts each element of the list into that slot and reports a list of the results.<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/map-plural-over-list-of-nouns.png"  alt="map-plural-over-list-of-nouns" title="map-plural-over-list-of-nouns">

                </li>
                <li>In your <code>map</code> script, replace <code>plural</code> with<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-()-y.png"  alt="join-(empty)-y" title="join-(empty)-y">. Try it. Now explain what the <code>map</code> block does, <em>in general</em>. </li>

                <li> 
                    <strong>Abstraction: </strong> Make a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h.png" alt="plural-h" title="plural-h"> block that "specializes" on just one category, words that end with the letter <strong>h</strong>.
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Start with a <code>list</code> of the words you want it to work for.</li>
                        <li>This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-crutch-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch" title="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-moth-with-result.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth" title="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-bush-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result" title="plural (for words ending in h) with result">. It can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input)" title="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input)"> because the <code>plural</code> block should never give words to <code>plural-h</code> unless those words end with <strong>h</strong>. </li>
                        <li>Test <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h.png" alt="plural-h" title="plural-h" > with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want. Then use <code>map</code> to test it on the entire <code>list</code> you made earlier.</li>
                    </ul>

                	<p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> Language often has special cases. In English, the plurals of some nouns add  <em>s</em>;  some   add  <em>es</em>;  nouns like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.</p>
                    <p><img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" title="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"></p>
                    <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and leaving the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable, and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more flexible. </p>
				</div>
				<li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
				<li> Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like 
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png"  alt="plural_y-tray-with-result" title="plural_y-tray-with-result"> and
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" alt="plural_y-sky-with-result" title="plural_y-sky-with-result">
				</li>
				<p>Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job that isn't its  specialty. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result" title="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result"> </p>
                <p>Make sure  <code>plural</code> gives it only the job it knows how to handle correctly.</p>

                    To receive full credit, your program must work with the following list:

                    NOTE: You will not receive credit for reporting the correct answer in an incorrect mannner. For example, if the input is "moth" and your script reports "moths" because the word "moths" is literally all the script returns it does not count. You must use join blocks appropraitely.

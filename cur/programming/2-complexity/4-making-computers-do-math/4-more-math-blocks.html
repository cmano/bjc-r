            In this assignment you will create more blocks to perform various mathematical operations. Each solution will be a block you can add to your mathematical library if you'd like.

        <div class="submission" id="first"> 
            Each item is an individual block you will create. Make sure to name them properly to make them easy to grade. You may use one block inside of another if you need to.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create a square root block. You can copy and paste this symbol for the name: âˆš <br/>
                    This block should take a single number and report back the square root of the number. Note there is another block in Snap to do a square root. That block uses a drop down box for selection. You are creating a standalone block that performs the same operation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a distance formula block. The distance formula is a version of the Pythagorean Theorem and can be used to calculate the distance between two points. Your block should take two x, y points as input. It should look like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/Lab9-DistanceFormula.png" style="height:2.6em;" alt="distance formula" title="distance formula" />. <br/>
                    If you don't remember the distance formula, you can search for it online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create an even count block. This block takes a list of numbers as input and reports the number of even numbers in the list. Call this block "even count".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a sum of even block. This block takes a list of numbers as input and reports the sum of the even numbers in the list. Call this block "sum of even".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a new sorted list block that sorts the list element values from smallest to largest. This one is a little tricky, but you built everything you need during the lab. You can accomplish this in any way you'd like, but here are some hints. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Use your minimum of list block that you created in the lab. When you find the minimum value, add that value to a another list (a script variable).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove that value from the original list. You can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/Lab9-DeleteIndex.png" style="height:2.6em;" alt="delete index of" title="delete index of" /> block to do this. You will need to know the index of the number in the original list. You can find that with the <img src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/Lab9-IndexOf.png" style="height:2.6em;" alt="index of" title="index of" /> block. Think about what the inputs of each of these blocks are and how you can combine them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep repeating this process until the original list is empty.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Report the sorted list you've been making.
                        </li>
                        <p>Here's an example to get you started. Note the original list script variable is set. Without append, the input list will also change, which means the list you used as input to the block would be erased too.<br/>
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/lab-9/Lab9-NewSortedListStarter.png" alt="distance formula" title="distance formula" />
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a median value block. This block takes a list of numbers and reports the median value (the value at the middle point of the sorted list, not the average of the list). You will probably want to use your sort block first. If you have an even number of values in the list, then the median should be the average of the two values closest to the middle. 
                </li>
                
            </ol>

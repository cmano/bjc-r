            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will build an automated fortune telling program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>&reg;</sup> that randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions. Click the video below to watch the app in action.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo"> 
            Create your own fortune-telling app. You will personalize it in a number of ways.
                <div class="endnote">
                    <p>You may wish to look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank" title="Magic 8-Ball">Wikipedia entry for Magic 8 Ball</a><sup>&reg;</sup> for some possible responses that the app could give to a yes/no question.  Notice that of the twenty possible answers listed, ten are affirmative (<span style="color:green">green</span>), five are non-committal (<span style="color: goldenrod">yellow</span>), and five are negative (<span style="color:red">red</span>).</p>

        <div class="submission" id="first">
            <ol>
                <!--<li>Play with the program <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U1L5Pong_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank"> linked here </a>to get a feel how the game works. Use the up and down arrow keys to move the paddle. The initial angle at which the ball starts is random, so if it is not to your liking, you can reload the page for a different initial angle.</li>-->
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <li>
                    Be creative with this assignment. You will create a Magic 8 Ball type of program, but it must not look like a Magic 8 Ball. It could be anything else (Well, anything that would be rated G or PG). The responses must fall into the same category. Come to think of it, depending on your personality, your creativity may be limited on this assignment.
                </li>
                <h3>Requirements</h3>

                <li>
                    When the program starts, let the user select from at least three different modes. Each mode is simply a different set of images used in place of the 8-ball. Give each mode a name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include at least 20 responses. Ten should be affirmative, five non-committal, and five negative. These are minimum numbers, but the proporation between each type should not change dramatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play a sound along with a message prompting the user to ask a question and then press the space bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play a sound and some type of animation that indicates your Magic Thing is thinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play a sound specific to the type of response (affirmative, non-committal, or negative) when the response is shown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 5 seconds as the user if they want to play again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a trick mode where you can press 1, 2, or 3 in order to force either an affirmative, non-committal, or negative response.

                Game Overview
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The computer will select a random sequence of four colors selected from eight color choices.</li>
                <li>The colors may not be repeated.</li>
                <li>The player guesses a sequence. ex: rgoy (red, green, orange, yellow)</li>
                <li>The computer reports two numbers</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>The number of colors in the correct position.</li>
                    <li>The number of correct colors (colors that appear in the sequence) but are in an incorrect position.</li>
                </ol> 
                <li>The player continues to guess until the correct sequence is discovered.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/mastermind-starter.xml"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account."></a><br />Look at the scripts. There are six sprites, four for the player's guess and two for the feedback to the guesser. You will need to add additional color sprites.</li>
                <div class="narrower">
                	<p><strong>Feedback to the guesser</strong> is two numbers (as shown in each row of the game in the image above):
                    	<ul>
                            <li>How many colors are in the <em>correct</em> positions? (The goal is to have all four correct.)</li>
                            <li>How many correct colors are in <em>incorrect</em> positions?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <!--This is not included in the code. --MF
                    The first, "correct position," sprite has two short scripts: one to be used at the beginning of the game, and the other to be used when a guess is made.-->

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ask the user for their name
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prompt the user for a guess with an appropriate message. Use the initials of the color for the guess.<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/mm1.png" alt="first guess interaction" title="first guess interaction" ></li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Display the guess on the screen along with the number of colors in the correct position and number of correct colors in an incorrect position.
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/mm2.png" alt="four colors displayed" title="four colors displayed">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat until the player guesses correctly.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Show a message congratulating the winner. Include their name and the total number of guesses they used.

            </ol>

                You'll find it useful for a script to be able to tell a particular sprite what to do.  There's a tool to do that: the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell.png" alt="tell (sprite) to (action)" title="tell (sprite) to (action)"> block.
                <br />
                For example:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-alonzo.png" height="82" alt="tell (Alonzo) to (say ...)" title="tell (Alonzo) to (say ...)"><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-correct.png" height="83" alt="tell (correct position) to (show value (# correct))" title="tell (correct position) to (show value (# correct))">

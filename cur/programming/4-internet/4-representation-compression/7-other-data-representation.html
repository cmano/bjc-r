            You've just scratched the surface on the ways computers represent data using binary numbering. In this assignment you'll investigate an additional way.

            <p>
                You are charged with creating a mini-lesson for a group of students. The lesson you create will include powerpoint slides or a handout, and a lecture or lecture script. The topic is data representation for colors. Do a search for "RGB Data Representation" to find resources. Even with just a few resources you should have enough information to learn from to create your lesson.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of ways this can be approached. Make sure to check a few online resources to find an approach that makes sense to you. Some sites are very technical and complex. Others cover it at a level similar to this lab. I would follow the latter, but it is up to you.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Visual presentation. Choose one.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Powerpoint slides (or similar). Minimum of 4 content slides (title page not included)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Worksheet handout (or similar). Single page handout. Should cover all material in the lesson or be a learning exercise students can complete.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Presentation. Choose one.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Record a 5-minute video of you giving the lesson</li>
                        <li>A script that is equal to a 5-minute presentation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include the links you used in your research/preparation somewhere on your slides or handout.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Turn in a single file, if possible. If you're doing a script, then include the handout and links as the last page of your script. If you do the video, then show your slides, including the links used as part of the video. You can do a screen capture so your video is a voice-over that just shows your slides. If you are going to video yourself giving the presentation, you may want to turn the slides in separately or edit images of the slides into your video. Name your file Last-First-Assn-18.XXX. The XXX is the appropriate extension. Use a pdf for text documents, and whatever is appropriate for your video (you don't need to change it from what it saves as when you create it).

        <div class="todo">
            <p>BH: Only the last TIF is TIFfy, and I really think it should be a regular FYTD.  Coloring the picture by hand is weird.</p>
            <p>MF: BH has reviewing to do (see TG)</p>

            This lab was packed full of information. In this assignment you will use all that you learned and will create a brand new type of social network. Just think, if you had done this 20 years ago, you'd be a billionaire!

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

            <p>
                You have the benefit of hindsight as you create your own social network. Many of the topics in this lab were afterthoughts during the design of social networks. Could a better design prevented issues?
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a design document (fancy way to say a report/paper) for a brand new social network. You should have the following sections/items. The entire document should be at least 2 pages. Choose narrowly focused items to discuss. This means when talking about something like cyberbullying, it's ok to just focus on one part of your social network, like picture sharing. This topic is incredibly broad and you could spend pages and pages on each item potentially.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Name of your social network
                </li>
                <li>
                    How does your social network work? What is the users experience like? Key highlights/functionality is fine. Take ideas from Page 1 of the lab for help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How is cyberbullying addressed?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you address censorship? Remember, your social network is not only in the USA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How is users data handled? Page 4 highlights similar issues with search engines. Remember, there are good ways to handle users data to make things nicer for them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How will your social network impact people throughout the world in different living circumstances?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the major benefits and unintended negative consequences of your social network? Not all negative consequences can be removed without removing important benefits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How will your social network impact societal and work collaboration?
                </li>

        <h3>A Bit More Preparation</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
				<li>
                	Experiment! Try varying your tree in the following ways: 
                	<ul>
                        <li>Change the turn angle.</li>
                        <li>Change the scale factor.</li>
                        <li>Change the number of branches at each level.</li>
                        <li>
                            Change the branching <em>structure</em>. 
                        	<p>For example, trees can have branches along the trunk <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-five-branches.png" height="150" alt="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top" title="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top"> or even a bent trunk <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">.</p>
                        </li>
                        <div class="endnote">
                            When you use more complicated structures or bend the trunk, returning the sprite to its original position—maintaining state transparency—becomes more of a nuisance. Instead of undoing each move and turn step by step, you can record the starting position like this<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/set-sprite-state.png" alt="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)" title="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)"><br />
                            using a block like this<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/sprite-pos-and-direction.png" alt="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}" title="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}"><br />
                            and build a <code>return sprite to state</code> block that returns the sprite to its original position.<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/return-sprite.png" alt="return sprite to state (sprite state)" title="to state return sprite (sprite state)">
                        </div>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change the pen thickness between levels, so that the trunk is really thick and the leaves are thin.<br />
                    <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/thicktree.png" alt="tree with thick trunk" title="tree with thick trunk">
                </li>
            	<li>
                    Make a brown trunk and branches and green leaves.<br />
                    <div class="sidenote">You do not have to get it exactly like the picture.</div>
                    <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/leafytree.png" alt="realistic tree" title="realistic tree" /><br />
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">You might have found the green leaves harder to debug than the varying thickness. If so, what went wrong with drawing the leaves green?  Why didn't the same problem come up for the thickness?</div>                
            </ol>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <p>You will enhance your tree program by prompting the user for various inputs, then draw a picture based on their input. Prompt for, and use, the following items. Tips on many of them are listed afterwards.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Angles (User enters a number, or selects that random numbers should be used)
                </li>
                <li>Scaling factor (User enters a number, or selects that random numbers should be used)</li>
                <li>Number of trees (make a forest)</li>
                <li>Gravity strength</li>
                <li>Leaf shape (at least 3 options)</li>
                <li>Leaf color (at least 3 options, and a random option whee each leaf color is randomly selected)</li>
            </ol>

        	<ol>

                	Add randomness in the choice of angles and scaling factors. Here are some examples:<br />

                	Make a forest by planting varied trees randomly on the stage.<br />

                    In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the branches  roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching structure looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting and beautiful.<br />

                </li>

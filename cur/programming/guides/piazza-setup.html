	<h1>Introduction to Piazza</h1>
	<p>
	    In this course, we will be using Piazza an online discussion forum. We automatically enroll everyone on <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2019/cs10/home">CS10's Piazza</a>, however if you join the class late, you need to add yourself <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2019/cs10">ENROLL HERE</a>. Piazza is a forum for you to discuss with your fellow classmates things that you have questions about. 
	</p>
	<p>    
	    It is also our MAIN method of communication for us as instructors to inform you of any updates and reminders in the class. However, the default email settings will send you updates every 4 hours, which will fill your inbox quickly. The tutorial below will walk you through updating the email settings.

	<div class="center">
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/piazza/account_email.png" alt="Account Email" align="left"height="306" width="300" />
      </div>

	<p>   
		<br />
		<br /> 
		<br /> 
		<br /> 
	    First, open Piazza and click the gear on the top right corner of the page by your name. A drop down menu (shown to the left) will appear. Click "Account/Email Settings."
	    <br />
	</p>

	<div class="center">
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/piazza/email.png" alt="Account Email" align="right"height="336" width="300" />
      </div>
		

       <p>   
		<br />
        <br />
	    Second, find the section on this page called "Class & Email Settings" and under find CS10. Under CS10 click the blue link that says "Edit Email Notifications" and the section will expand (shown to the right) to allow you to adjust your email settings. 
	    <br />

      <p>   
      <br /> 
       <br /> 
	    You should set your email settings to either "Real Time" (Receive an email as soon as any new question is asked or a new note is created) or No Emails (Only recieve emails from instructors). This way you will not get spammed with emails from Piazza and you won't miss any important announcement from the course staff posted on Piazza.

        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
                <li>If your project is open and the script is still running, click the red stop sign, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>. If it isn't open already, open your Lab1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked"/>

            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> a welcome message when the green flag is clicked. The welcome message should include your name, or both partners names for those working in pairs.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty text in the white <em><strong>input</strong></em> slot will make the sprite say nothing.</div>

                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.</li>
                        <li>Alonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn't face the other way) any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>

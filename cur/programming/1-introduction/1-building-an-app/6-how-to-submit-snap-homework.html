        <h2>Submit Snap Homework</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            This is your first example of submitting an assignment. Assignments are completed individually. This means if you're completing your labs in pairs, you need to stop working together and each of you must do the assignment by yourself.

            For some assignments you'll actually submit the code you created in Snap!. Follow these instructions for all Lab Checks and Assignments that require you to submit code.

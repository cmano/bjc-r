                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will use <code>for</code> loops to repeat <em>and count the repetitions</em> so you can use that counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns:<br />

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Iteration</strong>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.J.1</div>
            <p>Computer scientists describe a repeating program structure as <em>looping</em>, <em>repetition</em>, or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.K.1</div>
            <p>
                The code can be repeated <code>forever</code>, a specific number of times (such as when using <code>repeat</code>), or until something specific happens (such as when using <code>repeat until</code> as you'll see in Lab 5). <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-100-turn-right-90).png" alt="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" title="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-tiny-no-hat.png" alt="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
    point towards (Leader)
    move (1) steps
}" title="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
    point towards (Leader)
    move (1) steps
}" />            
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Sometimes the script inside a loop needs to know which time through the loop it's in (first, second, etc.).
            You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" title="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" /> to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />) in the repeated script. For example, the <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like: <br /> 
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" />  
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to  
            <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif" alt="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" title="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" /> 
		</p>
        <p>Each time the <code>for</code> block  runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.</p>   
    
        <div class="takeNote">The <code>for</code> block's default counter name, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" /> stands for "index." You can change this name by clicking it. To use the counter, drag it into the script.</div>

        	<strong>On this page,</strong> you will use your existing <code>pinwheel</code> block to make <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code> blocks.<br />

They expected an asterisk single colored and with equal spacing of spikes.  I agree that the point of this image as a superimposition of asteriskes of various inputs is too subtle and easily missed.</div>-->

                <li>
                    Use your <code>pinwheel</code> block to create a more specialized <code>asterisk</code> block.
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, make a new block called <code>asterisk</code> with two inputs: one for the <var>number of branches</var> and one for the <var>length</var> of each branch.  You may wish to review how to make a new block at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/4-making-a-new-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lab 2 Page 4: Making Your Own Block">Lab 2 Page 4: Making Your Own Block</a>.</li>

                        <li>Now fill in the three inputs to <code>pinwheel</code> so that it correctly draws an asterisk.</li>

                <li>
                	Similarly, write a <code>polygon</code> block that uses <code>pinwheel</code> with appropriate inputs to draw a polygon with a given number of sides and side length.<br />

            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.4</div>
            <p>Here is another kind of <em>abstraction</em>: noticing that <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code> are both kinds of pinwheels, and writing one, more general, <code>pinwheel</code> block that uses an input so that the block can be used to make asterisks, polygons, or other interesting designs.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.5</div>            
            <p>This is an example of <strong>abstraction by generalization</strong>: looking at chunks of code that are <em>almost the same</em> and writing a single block by <em>using an input</em> to distinguish among the different cases.</p>
        </div>
        
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li>If you look inside of <code>pinwheel</code> and see how you're using it in <code>polygon</code>, you'll see that there are steps that you don't really need for the case of a polygon.  Write another version of <code>polygon</code> built directly out of primitive blocks (<code>move</code>, <code>turn</code> and so on).  How simple can you make it?</li>

                    <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.7</div>
                    As long as your <code>polygon</code> block draws the right picture, it doesn't matter to the rest of the project what's inside it.

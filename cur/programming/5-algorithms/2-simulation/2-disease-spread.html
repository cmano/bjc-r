        <h2>Lab 21 Assignment: Disease Spread Project</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>Brian wants to do something with a real example (like weather modeling). --MF, 2/20/18</p>
            <p>PG: SCRAP. What I really mean is change, but major change. Again, what we're seeing is how clever someone else can be. Learning to model is different. The first few pages of DHH's Calculus text does a great job if building an intellectual model that could be programmed in Snap. Weather could be ok, but I think the disease spread might be easier to understand and model. I'd keep the /idea/ here, but stop trying to show off /our/ projects and instead teach a kid how to model.</p>
        </div>
    
		<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this assignment,</strong> you will model the spread of a disease in a population. You will write this program without any starter code, but you have learned everything you need to know. There are a few hints below.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Suppose you are a medical researcher at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and would like to understand the factors that contribute to the spread of a new disease. In particular, you want to know the effect of population size on the time it takes for everyone to be infected.</p>
        
        <h3>Pre-Simulation Questions</h3>
        <div class="submission" id="first">
            Answer these questions before you build your program (You'll submit these as part of your assignment submission). There is no right and wrong answer at this point. These are part of your hypothesis.
            <ol>
            	<li>What would be a sensible hypothesis on how population size affects the elapsed time?</li>
                <li>What if the space the people lived in (in the simulation, the size of the Snap<em>!</em> stage) was twice as big?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>You may not have enough data from actual outbreaks to test your hypothesis and make any meaningful conclusions, and it would be unethical to induce the disease in a population just to gather new data. In this situation, a simulation would be the best option to generate data to test your hypotheses without the constraints of time, cost, and ethics.</p>
        <p>In this project, you will simulate the spread of a disease within a small population and explore the effects of variables such as population size and speed of human interaction on the spread of disease.</p>
        
        <h3>Program Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission" id="second">
            As stated previously, you know everything you need to complete this program. Take some time to plan out how to build the program. A good place to start is to describe what is happening step-by-step in the video above. Note that in the video the final time isn't reported, but you'll need to do that.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Write a simulation that will:<br />
					<ul>
                        <div class="sidenoteBig">How do you make a collection of identical sprites? Create a single person sprite, and use the <code>create a clone of myself</code> block. You learned how to clone a sprite in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/5-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lab 11 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Lab 11 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.</div>
                        <li>Take 3 inputs: the population size, the percentage of the population initially infected, and the speed at which the simulated people should be moving around.</li>
                        <li>Infect a healthy person when they touch a sick person.</li>
                        <li>When the entire population becomes sick, stop the animation and report the duration of the outbreak.</li>
					</ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your program should be animated similar to the video demo above.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="endnote">Using clones is a form of parallelism. But as you learned on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/8-sequential.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lab 20 Page 8: Parallelism">Lab 20 Page 8: Parallelism</a>, because the clones are all running on one processor, cloning doesn't give you any speedup.</div>
        <h3>Analysis Questions</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            You will submit your answers to these questions as part of your homework submission.
			<ol start="3">
                <li>How is your simulation similar to and different from a real-life disease outbreak. Identify the <em>simplifying assumptions</em> you made in this simulation.</li>
			</ol>

        <h3>Program Add-on</h3>
        <div class="submission">


                
                    <div class="comment">AAP-3.F.8</div>
                    You want to know the effect of population size on the time elapsed. Because there is some randomness in the simulation, you are going to get some variation in the reported time. (This isn't a bug; in real life, random events affect the elapsed time.) Write a function in Snap<em>!</em> that runs the simulation 10 times while keeping the percent initially infected at 10 and the speed of infection at 2, and reports the average time elapsed.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/average-of-disease-spread.png" alt="average time for disease spread with population size: ()" title="average time for disease spread with population size: ()" />
                
                <div class="comment">AAP-3.F.7</div>
                <ol start=4>
                <li>Call this function four times with different populations (50, 100, 150, and 200), and write down the results. Create a refined hypothesis about the relationship between population size and time for the entire population to be infected.</li>
                <li>In real disease scenarios, not everyone ends up getting sick. How would you decide if the simplifications you used in a simulation invalidate the conclusions you might draw?</li>
			</ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
        <div class="submission">
                <ol start=6>
                <li>This is a simplified model. There are many things you could do to make the model more realistic. For example, you could make the infected people heal over time, or you could add doctor sprites who can heal sick sprites, but you will always have to make some simplifications. List 3 ways (other than the presence of doctors) that your program oversimplifies the problem. In other words, list some important things that occur in real-life that are not represented in your simulation.</li>

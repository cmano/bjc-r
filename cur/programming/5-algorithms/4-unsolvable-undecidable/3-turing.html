            <p>BH: Only the last TIF is TIFfy, and I really think it should be a regular FYTD.  Coloring the picture by hand is weird.</p>
            <p>MF: BH has reviewing to do (see TG)</p>

            This assignment is just a little bit different than previous assignments. The topic of undecidable problems is a very difficult, but important, issue in computer science and we have just scratched the surface. Instead of working to prove a problem in undecidable, this is a great time to look at one of the most important people in computer science. Here's a brief introduction to Alan Turing.

            <h4><strong>Who first proved the Halting Theorem?</strong></h4>
            <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was one of the founders of computer science. He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the German Enigma machine. Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology. Though his work on the Halting Problem, he proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.</p>
            <p>When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With powerful programming languages (such as Snap<em>!</em>), we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily because we can use functions as inputs to other functions, as you've seen with <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. This proof was even harder for Turing because he had to invent the idea of a computer program that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <p>Find a few articles about Alan Turing and the Enigma machine. In 2014, a movie called The Imitation Game was made about this amazing episode in history. However, the movie took dramatic license, and is not quite accurate, so please do not use it a resource.</p>
            <p>Write a one-page summary about what you learned in your research. Alan turing accomplished a great deal in his lifetime. Make sure to focus on his work on the Enigma and the impact that had on the world.</p>

            <p>BH: Only the last TIF is TIFfy, and I really think it should be a regular FYTD.  Coloring the picture by hand is weird.</p>
            <p>MF: BH has reviewing to do (see TG)</p>

            In this assginment, you will build a program similar to what you did in the lab. From the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/index.html" title="CORGIS Datasets Project" target="_blank">CORGIS Datasets Project</a> use the Weather dataset. Note that each line of the dataset contains weather information from the week, not a single day. The dataset covers a single year, 2016.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            In this lab you will write a program that can answer each of the following questions or perform the requested operation. Your program should simply have a button for each item that the user can click to view the results. This means when your program starts it will display a list of buttons to press. The user should be able to the button menu after viewing the results.
            <ol>
                <li>What was the average maximum temperature in the state of Texas?</li>
                <li>What was the highest average wind speed in Honolulu, Hawaii?</li>
                <li>How many weeks were there without rainfall in Tulsa, Oklahoma?</li>
                <li>What was the total (not total of weekly average!) rainfall for the year in Lansing, Michigan?</li>
                <li>Create a bar chart that shows a max temperature range and the number of times a city fell in the range. Use increments of 5 degrees. (Note: each city should be counted 52 times, once for each week.</li>
                <li>Do the same as the previous, but only use cities in California.</li>
                <li>Determine the maximum rainfall value for each city (the largest weekly value from the entire year). Create a bar chart that shows the maximum rainfall range and the number of cities that fell in the range. Each city should only be counted once in the graph.</li>

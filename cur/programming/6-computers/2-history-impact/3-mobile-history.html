        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <p>Mobile devices, as we know them, may feel like a recent development. However, mobile devices (phones) have been around for almost 100 years. Search on the Internet for information about mobile device history. You may only need a few sites to help you complete this assignment, but don't rely on the first ones you find. Many resources are incomplete.</p>
            <h4>Part 1</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a timeline, similar to page 1 of the lab, of major items in mobile computing. For each item note, in a brief sentence or two, why it's worthy of being on your timeline. Your timeline can be in list form, it doesn't need to be on a line.</li>
                <li>Include devices that introduce new and important capabilities (ex. first phone with a camera)</li>
                <li>Include landmark events. (ex. first wireless phone call)</li>
                <li>Include important mobile device related items (ex. opening of first mobile app store</li>
                <li>Include anything else you think is worthy of the list</li>
                <li>Your list should have at least 25 items</li>
                <li>Your timeline should begin sometime in the 1920's-1940's range</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Part 2</h4>
            <p>Consider the improvements over time in mobile devices that you learned about in part 1. Add to what you learned about Moore's Law on page 2 of the lab. Write a 1/2 page report about your thoughts on how Moore's Law applies or doesn't apply to mobile devices.</p>

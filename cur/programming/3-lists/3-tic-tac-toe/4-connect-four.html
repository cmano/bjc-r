        <h2>Lab 13 Assignment</h2>
        
        <div class="learn">
            In this assignment, you will build a classic game, Connect Four. However, it's not a cool Connect 4. It's really just a bigger Tic-Tac-Toe.<br />
            <div class="comment">I find the little circle confusing amidst all the shapes. Anyone else? --MF, 9/10/18</div>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The gameboard will be a 4x4.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prompt the users for their name, and let each player pick a color or an image for their game piece. You do not have to make a one-player version of the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Players take turns placing their pieces. Unlike Connect Four, they do not have to place the pieces in the bottom opening of a column.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have something indicating which player's turn it is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Detect wins (four in a row) and a tie. Display an appropriate message in each case. Use the winning player's name in a win message. The messages should be said by another Sprite, not the game board sprite.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            In this assginment, you will buid a classic game, Connect Four. The logic is very similar to the Tic-Tac-Toe game you just completed.<br />

                    The gameboard will be a 4x4. Not the same size as a real Connect Four game, but it will keep the logic similar to what you have done with Tic-Tac-Toe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prompt the users for their name, and let each player pick a color. You do not have to make a one-player version of the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Players select a column to place their piece. Their piece will go to the lowest open spot in that column. Animate it so the piece appears to fall from the top. Just a simple animation of showing the piece in each empty spot until it gets to the bottom is fine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have something indicating which player's turn it is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Detect wins (four in a row) and a tie. Display an appropriate message in each case. Use the winning player's name in a win message.

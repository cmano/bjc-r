            <p>
                Using what you have learned in this Lab, write a report that looks at a job you have had in the past, or currently have. If you have not had a job that you think applies, you may choose another job. However, it would be best if you could base your report on your own experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Report on the following that apply. You should be considering topics you learned about in this lab. You may consider other items you think are important, but you must show you understand the things you learned. Your report should be 2 pages.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Did the job exist 25 years ago? How was it different? Why didn't it exist?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How will computing impact the job in the future?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are working conditions like? How have they changed? How might they change in the future?

                <li>
                    Is the job part of an on-demand business? How has that impacted workers?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is remote work a possiblity? If so, how would it impact workers/customers/etc.? (Before you say it's not a possibility, remember remote surgery is a real thing!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    It outsourcing a possibility? What do you see as the pros and cons?

                <li>
                    Consider other aspects of how computing has affected jobs similar to yours, or how they might. Discuss the pros and cons of things you identify.

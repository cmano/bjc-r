        <h2>Lab 12 Assignment</h2>        
        <div class="learn">
            In this assignment, you will create a movie directory. You will be able to add movies and your personal ratings for each movie.<br />
        </div>
        
                
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <p>
                Your movie list program will have a number of features that are similar to the contact list program you completed.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Note the starter scripts associated with the stage and some of the button sprites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change each of the sprites to make your program more custom to fit your style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a constructor for a movie item. Each item should include the Title, Year Released, Rating, and Stars. Stars is your personal rating of the movie on a 5-star basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Add Movie button should prompt the user to enter each item for the constructor one, at a time, then create the movie item and add it to a list of all movies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Find Movie button should prompt the user to enter a key word. Then it will report a list of all movies that match. A match means the movie title contains the keyword.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Remove Movie button first uses a similar process as the Find Movie button. Then it prompts the user to enter the number of the movie from the displayed list to remove.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Filter stars asks the user for a star rating, then displays all movies with that rating or better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The host should be the sprite that does all of the talking and displaying of results. The only exception is the delete process which shows the list of movies after the search as a table. This is done by showing the script variable that holds the results of the search.
                </li>
            </ol>

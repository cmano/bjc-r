        <div class="learn">
            In this assignment, you will create a movie directory. You will be able to add movies and your personal ratings for each movie.<br />
        </div>
        
                
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <div class="submission">
            <p>
                Your movie list program will have a number of features that are similar to the contact list program you completed. Import the String and Multi-Line Input library to help you.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create the following sprites that will be used as buttons for certain functionality. You can use any image you make or find online. You can also draw your own in the paint feature in the costume tab.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Add movie
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find movie
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove movie
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Filter stars
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Create one additional sprite who acts as the assistant. This is the only sprite who will prompt the user for input or display responses. You can use the "Tell X to Y" block.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a constructor for a movie item. Each item should include the Title, Year Released, Rating, and Stars. Stars is your personal rating of the movie on a 5-star basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Add Movie button should prompt the user to enter each item for the constructor one, at a time, then create the movie item and add it to a list of all movies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Find Movie button should prompt the user to enter a key word. Then it will report a list of all movies that match. A match means the movie title contains the keyword. NOTE: MAKE A HELPER SCRIPT FOR THIS
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Remove Movie button first uses the same process as the Find Movie button. Then it prompts the user to enter the number of the movie from the displayed list to remove.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Filter stars asks the user for a star rating, then displays all movies with that rating or better.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

                        <li>Looking at the previous page, write down the questions your program is going to ask the user. The answers to these questions will be the program <em>input</em>.</li>

                            <p>We use "input" loosely to mean the empty boxes in a block that get filled with values.  But <strong>input</strong> also means information entered into a program by the user, as in the <code>ask and wait</code> block.  Program input can also come from data tables, sounds, pictures, video, or other programs.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, program <strong>output</strong> means any data sent from your program to the user or to any device.  Typically, the output depends on the input.</p>
                        </div>
                        <li>Make the script ask the user for contact data and then add that data to the <var>contact list</var> using the <code>contact</code> constructor.</li>

                                You'll want to ask the user for each piece of data (contact name, address, and phone number) separately.
								<ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>You <em>could</em> use several <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> blocks together with script variables</strong> to request and then store each piece of user input until you are ready to report them all together using <code>contact</code>.<br />
                                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-variables.png" alt="contact with name: (name) address: (address) phone: (phone)" title="contact with name: (name) address: (address) phone: (phone)" />
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong><em>Another way</em> that makes for cleaner code is to use <em>abstraction</em>: create helper blocks</strong> (such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/ask-name.png" alt="ask name" title="ask name" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/ask-phone.png" alt="ask phone" title="ask phone" />) that each ask the user for one piece of data and report their answer to the <code>contact</code> constructor.<br />
                                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-helpers.png" alt="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone)" title="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone)" /><br />
                                        Each of these helper blocks will <code>ask</code> the user a specific question (like, "What is the contact's address?") and then report the user's <code>answer</code>.
                                    </li>
								</ul>
                                <div class="endnote">

                                    	You could first build a more general <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/answer-to-prompt.png" alt="answer to prompt ()" title="answer to prompt ()" /> helper block (yet another abstraction) to use in the other helper blocks instead of rewriting the <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> script every time. <!--<br />

                    Develop a "Clear List" button that resets the <var>contact list</var> to an empty list, which is essential while programming whenever you change the structure of the ADT. Notice there is already a button called "Clear List". Add your script to that sprite.

		<div class="takeNote">Most of the programs you've written have one script that's in charge, using loop blocks to keep running either forever or just for a long time.  This project is different: Nothing happens until you click a button (recall from Unit 1 that this is called an <em>event</em>), which starts a script that just runs briefly, to do whatever action the button requires.  This kind of program structure is called <strong>event-driven</strong> programming.</div>
